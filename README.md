# Medical Image Segmentation Framework

This project implements multiple deep learning architectures for medical image segmentation, with a focus on encoder-decoder architectures and hybrid optimization techniques.

## Key Features

- **Modified SegNet Architecture** with:
  - Encoder-decoder structure with skip connections
  - Batch normalization layers
  - Custom hybrid loss function
  - Pretrained weights available

- **Hybrid Feature Guided Swarm Optimization (HFGSO)**:
  - Combines swarm intelligence with feature guidance
  - Optimizes model weights during training
  - Implemented in `Proposed_HFGSO_DRN/HFGSO.py`

- **Custom Loss Function**:
  - Combines weighted cross-entropy (Î²=0.75) 
  - Negative log of Dice coefficient
  - Defined in `Main/Proposed_SegNet.py`

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Intersection over Union (IoU)
  - Dice coefficient
  - Precision, Recall, Accuracy
