# Python version: 3.12.6
# Core dependencies for medical image analysis GUI
# python -m pip install numpy==2.1.3
# The issue occurs because the system Python (/usr/bin/python3) doesn't have the required packages. To run the GUI successfully:
# Always use the Python 3.12 environment where packages are installed:
# python -m Main.GUI
# Or install all requirements in system Python:
# sudo /usr/bin/python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# The first approach is recommended as all dependencies are already properly configured in Python 3.12.
# run the GUI, python -m Main.GUI
